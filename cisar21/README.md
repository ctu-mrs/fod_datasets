A dataset captured on the Císařský island in Prague in 2021.
This dataset includes also ground-truth positions of the interceptor and the target, measured using RTK[^1].

[^1]: Although the 3D position of the two is very accurate (up to a few centimeters), the orientation may not be as precise because that was only measured using a conventional magnetometer.
